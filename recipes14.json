Stir in orange zest, orange juice, and lemon juice. Bring mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently, and allow to boil about 1 minute (mixture should thicken slightly and become translucent). Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk together egg yolks and egg until very well blended. While mixing egg mixture, slowly pour 1/4 cup of the hot orange juice mixture over eggs and stir until well blended. Remove saucepan from heat (once it's boiled as listed above) and while stirring mixture in saucepan, slowly pour egg mixture into saucepan. Reduce burner temperature to medium-low heat and return saucepan to burner and cook, stirring constantly (and whisking rather vigorously to prevent curdling) until mixture thickens well, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat, add butter and stir until combined. Pour into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap pressing directly against surface of filling, and chill 2 hours.For the cake:Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour 3 9-inch round cake pans (lightly butter sides), set aside. To the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or using a bowl and electric hand mixer), add 1 1/3 cups granulated sugar, baking powder, salt and sift cake flour into bowl. Pour in canola oil, egg yolks (while reserving the whites in a separate mixing bowl) and orange juice. Blend mixture on medium-high speed until smooth, about 3 - 4 minutes (slightly less if using a paddle attachment that has the scraper), occasionally scraping down sides and bottom of bowl. Blend in orange zest and vanilla extract.In a large mixing bowl, using an electric hand mixer (or if you have two stand mixer bowls you can use your stand mixer with the whisk attachment), whip 5 reserved egg whites with 1/2 tsp cream of tartar on moderately high speed until stiff (but not dry) peaks form. Add half of the whipped egg whites to the batter and fold until partially combined, then add remaining half of the whipped egg whites and fold just until combined (be careful not to overfold and deflate the eggs).Divide batter evenly among prepared baking pans and bake in preheated oven 17 - 19 minutes until toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean. Allow to cool in cake pans 10 minutes, then invert onto wire racks to cool completely before frosting with meringue.For the meringue:Add 6 egg whites (don't allow one drop of egg yolk) and sugar to a very clean heatproof bowl and set over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Heat mixture, stirring constantly, until it registers 160 degrees on a candy thermometer, about 3 - 5 minutes. Remove bowl from saucepan, add 1/4 tsp cream of tartar and beat mixture with an electric stand mixer on medium-high speed until stiff glossy peaks form, about 7 - 9 minutes (possibly longer in a humid environment).To assemble cake:Trim tops of each cake off to form an even layer. Spread half of the chilled orange filling over 1 layer of the cake (crumb/top side up, drop in a large dollop and spread outward so it doesn't get all crumby), leaving about a 1/2-inch rim of cake uncoated (because once the other layers are added the weight will slightly push the filling outward). Top with another layer of the cake (crumb/top side up), followed by remaining half of the orange filling, leaving a 1/2-inch rim of cake uncoated. Top with last layer (crumb/top side down) and spread meringue over entire cake. Toast meringue with a culinary torch until golden brown (and keeping a close eye making sure to blow any little flame out). Serve immediately or store covered in refrigerator and bring to room temperature before enjoying.Recipe Source: Filling - Cooking Classy, chiffon cake - adapted with slight changes from Southern Living, meringue - adapted from many different sources I've learned how to make meringue from, ratios my own.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the orange filling:In a medium saucepan, whisk together sugar, cornstarch and salt.

As the sugar begins to melt, stir it frequently to help it melt evenly. Continue to cook and stir until the caramel begins to smoke slightly and is a deep amber color. Cook for just a touch more, allowing the flavor to develop a bit more. Remove from heat and let sit 2 minutes. Then carefully stir in the butter. Now slowly stir in the coconut milk, Irish whiskey and salt (it will bubble up quite a bit). Whisk to incorporate. Some of the sugar will harden around the spoon or whisk, this is fine. Return the pot to medium heat and simmer 3-4 minutes or until the sugar has melted and the sauce is smooth. Set aside.!To make the BrowniesLine an 8x8 or 9x9 inch baking dish with parchment paper or foil, letting the edges over hang from the pan so you can easily lift the brownies out of the pan later. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.Add the butter and 2 ounces milk chocolate to a medium size mixing bowl that is microwave safe. Microwave the butter and chocolate on 30 second intervals, stirring after each interval until melted and smooth. This takes me about 1 minute and 30 seconds.To the melted chocolate mixture add the sugar and instant coffee, whisking until completely combined. Add the vanilla, Guinness and egg and whisk until smooth. Stir in the cocoa powder, flour and salt until smooth and just combined, try not to over mix the batter. It will be thick. Stir in the remaining 4 ounces chopped milk chocolate or semisweet chocolate chips. Pour half the batter into the prepared pan. Now grab the caramel and drizzle about 1/4 cup of the caramel over the brownies. Add the remaining batter overtop, don't worry about the batter covering the whole surface. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the brownies are set on top. Do not over bake, if anything under bake. Allow to cool and then cut into 8-16 bars (depending on the size of you glasses).!To Make the Irish Cream Fudge Sauce (may use store bought fudge sauce)Stir together cocoa powder, brown sugar, Irish cream, salt and half of the chocolate (3 ounces). Place in a small sauce pan and cook over medium heat, stirring, until chocolate is melted. Cook mixture at a low boil, stirring occasionally for 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat, add remaining chocolate, butter and vanilla and stir until smooth.

Fold a long piece of heavy foil into a 13\" wide strip and fit it inside a 9\"x13\" metal baking pan, leaving foil overhang on the 2 long sides. Spray the foil with nonstick spray.Stir the butter and chocolate in a large heavy saucepan over very low heat until chocolate is melted. Remove from heat and whisk in the sugar, and then the eggs, 1 at a time. Whisk in espresso powder, vanilla, and salt. Then sift the flour over the chocolate mixture and stir to blend well. Transfer batter to prepared pan.Bake brownies until slightly puffed and dry-looking and tester inserted into center comes out with some moist batter attached, about 20 minutes. Let cool completely in pan on rack.Run a knife around the inside edge of the brownie pan. Use the overhanging foil as an aid and gently lift the brownies from the pan. The pan I used produces a brownie that is 1/2\" thick. Be sure your cookie cutter is taller than 1/2\". Press round biscuit cutter (mine was 2-1/4'' in diameter) firmly into the cooled brownie. Use a thin metal spatula to lift the cookie cutter filled with brownie from the foil. Gently press the brownie out of the biscuit cutter. Repeat the cutting process until your brownie looks like a big piece of swiss cheese. Place all glaze ingredients in a small saucepan and simmer over medium heat, stirring constantly until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Cool for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally until the glaze is thickened, but still pourable. Stir until completely smooth, then drop a large teaspoonful onto the center of a brownie round, and spread it out to the edges. Repeat until all brownie rounds are glazed. Let set while preparing the marshmallow meringue.In a medium heat-proof bowl (if you have a stand mixer, use that bowl), combine the egg whites, sugar, and cream of tartar. Place bowl over a pan of simmering water (or use a double boiler), making sure the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water. Whisk ingredients until sugar is dissolved and egg whites are warmed to 145°. This should take about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove bowl from heat and place on stand mixer. Using the whisk attachment, start beating on low until the mixture thickens just a bit. Then turn speed up to high until stiff, glossy peaks form. This should take about 10 minutes. Spoon meringue into a pastry bag fitted with a large round tip (I used Ateco #808) and swirl onto the glazed brownie rounds. Use a kitchen torch to gently toast the meringue. Finish by inserting a broken piece of graham cracker into the meringue.These keep very well refrigerated for a day or two.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 325°.

Butter and line the bottom of 9 by 13-inch cake pan with parchment paper, overlapping on 2 sides to create flaps.                          Put chopped the chocolate in a bowl. Heat cola just to a simmer over low heat and pour over chocolate. Let stand for 5 minutes; stir until smooth.                          Whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl.                          In another large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until slightly thickened and pale, about 3 minutes. Gradually add the oil, buttermilk, vanilla, and melted chocolate mixture to eggs. Beat on low until combined well, but not aerated. Add the flour mixture and continue to beat until just combined. (Stir lightly with a rubber spatula to remove any pockets of flour.) Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until the cake springs back lightly when touched, and a tester inserted in center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.                          Cool cake completely in the pan on a rack. Run a knife around edge of the pan and invert cake onto a rack. Carefully remove parchment paper and cool completely. (The cake may be made in advance, tightly wrapped and kept at room temperature for up to 2 days.)                          Whisk the flour and salt in a medium bowl.                          Beat the butter and sugar in another medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla mixing until fully incorporated. Slowly add the flour mixture, and continue beating just until the dough comes together, stopping and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.                          Divide dough in half, pat into disks, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours and up to overnight.                          Generously flour a clean work surface. (Tip: for a nice, even layer of flour, sift flour over work station.) Roll chilled dough about 1/4-inch thick. Cut into desired shape using a cookie cutter, working quickly enough that the dough stays chilled. (If dough gets warm and soft, put it in refrigerator on a lined baking sheet to chill, about 30 minutes.) Transfer cut cookies to un-greased baking sheets, leaving about 1-inch between cookies. Lightly dust off excess flour with a dry pastry brush. Refrigerate the formed cookies for at least 30 minutes. (Excess dough can be gathered together, pressed into a disk, chilled and rerolled.)                          Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Bake the cookies, until the bottoms and sides are barely golden, about 12 to 15 minutes depending on shape. Cool on the baking sheets until firm enough to transfer to a rack to cool. Decorate as desired and serve. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Special equipment: Plastic goal posts, available a specialty baking stores","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"For the cake: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.
