If you don’t have a double boiler (and I don’t) place a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of water. Stir a little so that the cream heats evenly. Once you reach 175, bring up the temperature—180 to 200 degrees. Keep that temp for about 45 minutes to an hour. At this point the cream will take on a cracked, yellow skin. Next, remove the bowl or top of your double boiler and settle in a pan of ice water to cool quickly. Cover with plastic wrap and stow in the fridge overnight. Then carefully skim the clotted cream off the top with a shallow spoon and layer it into a bowl. It will keep for about a week in your fridge. Use the rest of the cream as you would regular cream (it will be thinner than heavy cream, but can still be added to beverages). Preheat the oven to 425 and prepare a baking sheet with butter or parchment paper. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together and then work in the butter. Make a well in the middle and then add the egg and milk. Mix to form a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and then knead quickly until the dough comes together. Roll out the dough to an inch thick, then cut into rounds with a biscuit cutter or water glass. Move to the baking sheet and brush the tops with the beaten egg. Bake for 8 minutes or until golden.  Serve your clotted cream with strawberries or jam on a scone, a slice of pie, or anything that lends itself to cream.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a double boiler over medium heat bring the cream to 175 degrees.

Place it in a 10-inch wide, 1 1/2-inch high tart pan, pressing the dough into the corners.  Use a rolling pin to roll over the surface of the tart pan to cleanly cut off the excess dough from the edges.  Freeze for at least half an hour before blind-baking.1b Pre-bake the frozen crust (also called \"blind\" baking).  Preheat oven to 350°F. Line the frozen crust with heavy duty aluminum foil or with parchment paper.  Allow for a couple inches to extend beyond the sides of the tart or pie pan.  Fill two-thirds with dry beans or other pie weights (I've heard copper pennies work well for this too).  If you are using a pan with a removable bottom, place the pan on a rimmed baking sheet in the oven to catch any spillage. Bake for 20 minutes. Then remove from oven, remove the pie weights (the easiest way to do this is to lift up the foil by the edges) and the foil.  Using the tines of a fork, poke little holes all around the base of the crust.  Return to the oven and bake for another 10 minutes, until lightly browned all over. Remove from oven and set aside.2 Cook the bacon. Heat a large frying pan on medium heat.  Arrange strips of bacon in a single layer on the bottom of the pan (you may need to work in batches or do two pans at once). Slowly cook the bacon, turning the strips over occasionally until they are nicely browned and much of the fat has rendered out.  Lay the cooked strips of bacon on a paper towel to absorb the excess fat.  Pour fat out of the pan into a jar (not down the drain, unless you want to clog the pipes) for future use, or wait until it solidifies and discard in the trash.  Chop the cooked bacon crosswise into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch pieces.3 Preheat oven to 350°F.  Whisk the eggs in a large bowl. Add the nutmeg, salt, black pepper and chives and whisk a little more. Add the milk and cream and whisk vigorously to incorporate and introduce a little air into the mix – this keeps the texture of the quiche light and fluffy.Arrange the bacon and cheese in the bottom of the pie crust.Whisk the egg-milk mixture hard again for a few seconds, then pour it gently into the pie crust. You want the bacon and cheese to be suspended in the mix, so you might need to gently stir it around just a little. You also want the chives, which will float, to be evenly arranged on top, so move them around with a spoon until you like where they are. 4 Put the quiche into the preheated oven and bake for 30-40 minutes. (If using pan with removable bottom, be sure to place a rimmed baking sheet underneath.) Check for doneness after 30 minutes by gently jiggling the quiche. It should still have just a little wiggle. (It will finish setting while it cools.) Cool on a wire rack.Eat at room temperature, cold (a quiche will keep for several days in the fridge), or reheated gently in a 200-degree oven.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"1a If you are making your own pie crust, roll out the pie dough into a 12-inch round.","ingredients":[{"id":18334,"name":"pie crust","image":"pie-crust.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Place it in a 10-inch wide, 1 1/2-inch high tart pan, pressing the dough into the corners.

paddle attachment, mix together the flour, sugar, and salt for 10 to 15 seconds. Scatter the butter over the top. Mix on low speed for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, or just until the flour is no longer bright white and holds together when you clump it. Lumps of butter the size of pecans should be visible throughout the dough.In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and milk until blended. Add to the flour mixture all at once. Mix on low speed for about 30 seconds or until the dough just barely comes together. It will be a shaggy mess.Dump the dough onto an unfloured surface and gather it into a tight mound. Using your palm and starting on one side of the mound, smear the dough bit by bit, starting at the top and sliding your palm down the side and along the work surface.

Turn the waffle iron to its highest setting, even if you don’t usually heat it this high. (Trust us. These waffles come out best when cooked at high heat.)2. Pour the oat bran into a small bowl. Bring 1 cup of the milk to just shy of a boil. Add the hot milk to the oat bran and stir, then set aside to soften while you gather the rest of the ingredients.3. Sift the flours, baking powder and salt into a large bowl, pouring back into the bowl any bits of grain or other ingredients that may remain in the sifter.4. Put the egg whites in the clean bowl of a standing mixer and the yolks into a medium bowl. Add the maple syrup and vanilla to the egg yolks and whisk until thoroughly combined.5. Add the remaining 1 cup of milk to the oat bran—the cold milk will cool the lingering heat of the bran. Pour the oat mixture into the maple syrup mixture and stir to combine.6. Using a spatula, add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and gently combine. The batter will still have fine lumps throughout; resist the urge to mix them in.7. Attach the mixing bowl and the whip to the mixer and turn the mixer to high speed. As the egg whites whip, they will become frothy and begin to increase in volume. Add the 1 tablespoon sugar to the frothy whites, which will turn thick but very soft. Continue whipping until they are fluffy and glossy and hold their peaks, like clouds or cotton candy, 2 to 3 minutes total. (You’ll know the whites are overwhipped if they crack and look mealy. If that happens, throw them out and start over. There’s no salvaging them.)8. Scrape half of the egg whites into the batter, gently folding them into the batter so as not to deflate the air in the whites. Add the remaining egg whites and fold gently to combine. The egg whites should be entirely incorporated into the batter and the batter should be quite fluffy.9. As soon as you finish mixing the batter, go ahead and make the waffles as unlike some batters that can be kept in the fridge overnight, this one will deflate if left to sit, chilled or otherwise.10. Brush the waffle iron generously with butter. Using a ladle or measuring cup, scoop 1/2 cup of batter onto the iron. Promptly close the lid and listen for the iron to sigh as the batter begins to cook. The smell wafting from the iron will start out like a freshly kneaded loaf of bread, then become toasty. Remove the waffle when the indicator light shows that it’s done or when a quick peek shows that it has turned a dark golden-brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove the hot waffle with a fork. Repeat with the remaining batter.11. These waffles are best eaten hot, right off the iron, with a thin slab of butter melting on top and maybe a dab of jam.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Turn the waffle iron to its highest setting, even if you don’t usually heat it this high.
