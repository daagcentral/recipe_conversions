Butter the bottom and sides of the parchment and dust generously with confectioner's sugar to cover all of the buttered area. In the bowl of a stand mixer, sprinkle the gelatin over the water. Allow to sit while you prepare the syrup so the gelatin blooms. In a small saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer and set over medium heat, combine boiling water, sugar, and salt. Whisk frequently until the mixture begins to boil. Once boiling, stop whisking and allow to boil until the candy thermometer reads 236 F***. Remove the syrup from the heat and slowly pour into the mixer over the bloomed gelatin. Add the peppermint extract.Beat the ingredients together at medium speed for about 20 minutes, until the mixture is thick and white like marshmallow creme and has expanded substantially. Once it starts to look sticky, particularly around the sides of the mixer bowl, it should be done. Butter a spatula (and offset one works well) and pour the marshmallow mixture into the prepared dish. Smooth the top with the back of the spatula, starting at one corner and moving up, down, and across the dish in a swirling motion until you reach the opposite corner. Add about 15 drops of red food coloring, scattered randomly over the top of the marshmallows. Swirl the color around with a toothpick. Place the marshmallows in the freezer, uncovered, overnight. Lay out a large piece of parchment paper to use while dipping the marshmallows in chocolate. Remove the marshmallows from the freezer and lift out of the dish using the sides of the parchment. Carefully peel the parchment down from the sides of the marshmallows. Butter a pair of kitchen shears and cut the marshmallows into strips, and each strip into cubes (sized like jumbo marshmallows). Set cut marshmallows on the clean parchment, swirled-side up. Bring a pot of water to a simmer on the stove over medium-low heat. Place the chocolate in a bowl over the simmering water and allow to melt, stirring frequently once it begins to melt until it's smooth. For the marshmallow pops, stick the tip of a cake pop stick into the melted chocolate, covering about 3/4\" with chocolate. Stick the chocolate-covered end into the center of a marshmallow on the swirled-side. Leave on the parchment, stick-up, while you repeat with the remaining marshmallows. Once finished, coat each marshmallow with chocolate by using a spatula with a flat tip to push some chocolate up each side. Use the spatula to spoon chocolate onto the bottom of the marshmallow as well (the side opposite the pop stick). Sprinkle peppermint candy pieces over the chocolate, if desired, and then return the marshmallow pop to the parchment, again stick-side up, to allow the chocolate to set. Repeat with remaining marshmallows. To make chocolate-covered marshmallows without the pop sticks, simply dip the bottom and sides of each marshmallow into the chocolate, leaving the swirled-side exposed, and return to the parchment, swirl-side up, to set. Once the chocolate has set on all of the marshmallows, place them in an airtight container. Marshmallows can be stored at room temperature, but if you don't plan to finish them within a few days, keep them in the freezer so they stay softer. Marshmallows with peppermint candy coating look best the day they are made.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Butter an 11\" x 7\" baking dish and line with parchment paper.

With the mixer on low speed, beat in flour to combine. Mix in vanilla.2. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Divide into three equal pieces, and shape into flattened disks; wrap each in plastic. Refrigerate at least 1 hour or overnight.3. Preheat the oven to 325°F, with racks in the upper and lower thirds. Line three baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. In food processor, pulse together the walnuts, remaining ¼ cup granulated sugar, the cinnamon, and pinch of salt until finely ground; set aside. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out one disk of dough into a 10-inch round about ¼ inch thick. Brush the top evenly with melted jelly. Sprinkle with a third of the walnut mixture and a third of the currants. Using the rolling pin, gently roll over the round to press the filling into the dough.4. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, cut the round into 16 equal wedges. Beginning with the outside edge of each wedge, roll up to enclose filling. Place about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Repeat with remaining dough and filling ingredients. Lightly beat the whole egg; brush over tops, and sprinkle with sanding sugar.5.

Make the Cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease three 8-inch round cake pans, line the bottoms with rounds of parchment paper, grease the parchment, then flour the insides of the pans, tapping out excess; set aside. 2. In the bowl of an electric mixer (or large mixing bowl if you're using a hand mixer), sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, coffee, oil and vanilla.3. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix for 2 minutes on medium speed. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl and mix for an additional 20 seconds (the batter will be very thin). 4. Divide the batter evenly among prepared pans. Bake for 20 minutes and rotate the pans in the oven. Continue to bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of one of the cakes comes out almost clean (with a few moist crumbs), about 12 more minutes. Cool the cakes (in the pans) on wire racks for 20 minutes, then carefully turn them out onto cooling racks to cool completely.5. Make the Nougat Filling: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the sugar and evaporated milk, stirring until dissolved, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the pan from heat and add the marshmallow fluff, peanut butter, and vanilla extract, stirring until completely smooth. Fold in the peanuts. Let the nougat mixture cool to room temperature before using it in the cake. You can do this leaving it at room temperature or you can pop it into the refrigerator to speed up the process. Be sure to give a stir occasionally as it cools.6. Make the Frosting: Beat together the butter and cream cheese on medium-high speed for 5 minutes (I like to use the whisk attachment for my KitchenAid stand mixer, but it's not necessary). Pour in the salted caramel and beat until combined. Reduce the speed to medium-low and slowly add the powdered sugar, a little at a time, until it has all been incorporated. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat for an additional two to three minutes, until light and fluffy.7. Assemble the Cake: If your cakes baked up uneven or have domed on top, level off the tops. Place one cake layer on a serving plate. Cover with half of the nougat filling and then spread a couple spoonfuls of the salted caramel sauce over top to evenly cover the nougat filling. Top with a second cake layer and cover with the remaining nougat filling and top with caramel sauce. Place the final cake layer on top face-down. Frost the cake with the salted caramel frosting, finishing it as smoothly as possible. Refrigerate the cake for at least 1 hour, until the frosting is set.8. Make the Chocolate Ganache: While the cake chills, make the chocolate ganache. Place the chocolate in a medium bowl; set aside. Place the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat and warm until it just comes to a boil. Pour the cream over the chopped chocolate and let sit for 2 minutes. Begin whisking the mixture in the center, gradually working your way outward until the ganache is completely smooth. Set aside to cool, whisking occasionally, until it has thickened slightly, yet still a pourable consistency.9. Garnish the Cake: Transfer the ganache to a 2-cup measuring cup. Slowly pour the chocolate ganache into the center of the cake, letting it push itself outward and flow over the sides of the cake. Refrigerate the cake for at least 30 minutes, giving the ganache a chance to set up. To finish garnishing, drizzle some additional salted caramel sauce over the top and side of the cake, and top with chopped peanuts. Keep the cake refrigerated, removing it from the refrigerator about 20 minutes prior to serving.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the Cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

The woody fibers in the bottom will not soften with cooking and are not pleasant to eat.Place the washed and trimmed asparagus in a large skillet with about 1 cup of water (enough water so that the asparagus are half submerged when laying flat. See photos below). Bring the water up to a boil over medium/high heat. Simmer the asparagus until they are tender but not mushy and are still bright green (about 5-10 minutes). Use a fork to test their tenderness. If you have a lid for your skillet, use it to trap the steam and they will cook faster.Pour off any excess water from the asparagus and season with 1 tsp of butter, a dash of salt, pepper and garlic powder.

Take the paper out of the tin and draw two lines at equal intervals between the bottom and top edge lines you have already drawn. (This will help you make each layer exactly the same depth when filling the tin.) Lightly grease the paper and use to line the tin.Whip a third of the cream to just soft peak stage, then chill.
