Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and lightly flour a 10-inch tube pan. Sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, and cocoa powder. Combine the sour cream and vanilla extract in a separate bowl.                            Beat the butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy, about 30 seconds. Gradually add 2 cups of sugar and beat on high speed until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably paler in color. Add the room-temperature egg yolks one at a time, allowing each yolk to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next.                            Pour in one third of the flour mixture and mix on low speed until combined. Blend in half of the sour cream mixture. Continue adding the flour mixture alternately with the sour cream, mixing until just incorporated. Fold in the chocolate chips.                            Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar in a clean mixing bowl with clean beaters until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and beat until medium-stiff peaks are formed (lift your beater or whisk straight up: the tip of the peak formed by the egg whites should curl over slightly.)

After giving them a good rinse, I find the easiest way to pit cherries is with my handy dandy cherry pitter. Sure, it doesn't have much uses besides pitting cherries, but when you don't have it, pitting cherries is, well, the pits.In a large sauce pan, combine the sugar and cornstarch. Stir to blend. Add the water and lemon juice and whisk until smooth. Stir in the pitted sweet cherries.Cook, stirring constantly, over a medium-high heat until the mixture comes to a boil.

Adjust an oven rack to the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease the bottom and sides of a 10-by-15-inch baking sheet with butter.                          For the crust: To form the bottom crust, place 1 pie crust between two large pieces of floured parchment paper and roll into a 14-inch round. Lay the round over half of the prepared baking sheet; there will be overhang on the edges. Repeat the rolling process with a second pie crust. Lay it over the remaining exposed side of the baking sheet so that the two crusts overlap in the center of the pan; there will be overhang on the edges. Press together the overlapping crusts to make a tight seal. Transfer the filling to the crust and spread in an even layer. Dot the top with the butter.                          For the lattice crust: Repeat rolling the remaining 2 pie crusts into two 14-inch rounds. With a chef's knife or a pizza cutter, cut each crust into 1-inch-wide strips. Lay half the strips diagonally across the entire pie, about 1-inch apart. Weave the remaining strips diagonally across the first strips to make a lattice pattern. Trim the the lattice ends leaving an overhang, Press together the ends and the bottom edge of the crust to seal, then fold and crimp the edge as desired.                          Brush the lattice and edge of the crust with the cream and sprinkle generously with some granulated sugar. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly, 45 to 55 minutes. (If the crust browns too quickly during baking, cover the pie loosely with foil.) Let cool.                          For the topping: Meanwhile, whip the cream, sour cream and brown sugar in a large bowl to medium peaks. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

Make the Cupcakes: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a standard-size muffin pan with liners. Place the chopped chocolate and cocoa powder in a medium bowl. Pour the hot coffee over the mixture and whisk until smooth. Refrigerate mixture for 20 minutes.2. Meanwhile, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt and baking soda in a medium bowl; set aside.3. Whisk the oil, eggs, vinegar and vanilla extract into the cooled chocolate mixture until smooth. Add the flour mixture and whisk until smooth.4. Divide the batter evenly between the muffin pan cups. Bake until the cupcakes are set and just firm to the touch, 17 to 19 minutes. Cool the cupcakes in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then remove the cupcakes from the pan and place on the wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.5. Make the Frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer, whisk together the sugar, egg whites, water and cream of tartar. Set the bowl over a pan of barely simmering water and whisk until sugar is dissolved and the mixture reaches 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer. Transfer the bowl to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and beat on high speed until the frosting forms stiff peaks, about 12 to 16 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and beat until combined.6. Transfer the frosting to a large pastry bag fitted with a ½-inch round decorating tip (I used an Ateco #808 tip). Pipe a high swirl of frosting onto the top of each cupcake. Transfer the cupcakes to a baking sheet and refrigerate while preparing the chocolate coating.7. Make the Chocolate Coating: Combine the chocolate and oil in a medium heat-proof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water and stir until melted and smooth. Transfer to a small (deep) bowl, and cool to room temperature.8. Holding each cupcake by its bottom, quickly dip each cupcake into the chocolate to coat the frosting, and place on a wire rack. Let the cupcakes stand at room temperature 15 minutes, then refrigerate for 30 minutes uncovered. Place in a covered container and refrigerate 2 additional hours before serving. Cupcakes can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the Cupcakes: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

(Note: the dough will be stiff.)Scoop out 2 level teaspoons of dough and roll into a ball (the balls should be small, around the size of a chestnut). Continue rolling small, evenly sized balls of dough, spacing them around 1 1/2\" to 2\" apart on the prepared baking sheets.Using a glass with a flat bottom, first dip it in cocoa powder to prevent sticking and then flatten dough balls to about 1/8\" to 3/16\" thick (I just pushed the glass down as long as I could). Bake the cookies for 18-20 minutes. (If you start to smell scorching chocolate before the time is up, take them out.)In the meantime, make the Cookie Dough Filling: In a medium bowl, beat together the butter, sugars, milk, and vanilla. Add the flour and salt and stir until just incorporated. Stir in the mini chocolate chips.Refrigerate for 15-20 minutes, or until the dough is firmer but still malleable.Assemble the cookies: Pair up faux-reo cookies of similar sizes. Add a teaspoon of cookie dough to the inside of one cookie, and then push its pair on top until the dough spreads in between them (if the dough is too stiff, you can leave it on the counter until it reaches room temp). Continue until you finish assembling all of your cookie dough faux-reos, then enjoy immediately or place in air-tight container and refrigerate.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Make the faux-reos: Preheat the oven to 325°F.

Transfer to a heat-proof bowl, cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or until completely cool.On a floured surface, roll out your dough of choice into a thin sheet.

Roll out your pie crust slightly thinner than you would if making a standard pie.Cut out rounds of dough using a 3 1/2-inch circle cutter. Drop a heaping tablespoonful of filling into the center of each round. Lightly moisten the edges with your finger and some water, as this will help the dough stick to itself. Gently fold the round in half, encasing the filling, and press along the edges to seal. You can also use a fork to crimp the edges and further reinforce the seal.

Preheat oven to 3752. Line an 8x8 inch baking dish with nonstick foil, using 2 pieces so you have some overlap hanging over all sides.3. Cut the piecrust dough into rough 9x9 inch squares. Place the first square in the baking dish, pressing the edges a little ways up the sides.4. Scatter the cereal over the dough, and then put the peaches in a layer on top of the dough.5. Pour the brown sugar evenly over the peaches.6. Top with the second crust and press the edges down towards the bottom crust. They don't have to be sealed. Cut a few steam slices in the top crust and bake until golden, 50-60 minutes.7. Cool in the pan for about ten minutes and then carefully remove from the pan, using the foil edges as handles.
