In a glass measuring cup or small bowl, combine yeast and 1 cup warm water. Add a pinch of sugar and let sit for 5 minutes. 2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, add semolina flour, all-purpose flour, and salt. Mix the ingredients until combined. 3. Add the yeast mixture to the flour mixture. Next, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Mix until combined. Switch to the dough hook and knead for about 5 minutes on medium speed. 4. Spray a large bowl with cooking spray. Form dough into a ball and place in the bowl. Cover pizza dough with a damp towel and set in a warm area to rise. Let the dough rise for 1 hour or until dough has doubled in size. To make the balsamic reduction:1. While the dough is rising, make the balsamic reduction. Pour balsamic vinegar into a small saucepan, bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the vinegar has reduced to 1/4 cup. Set aside, and cool to room temperature.To make the pizza:1. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F or as high as your oven will go. If you have a pizza stone, place the pizza stone in the oven to get hot. 2. After the dough has risen, cut the dough in half. Take one piece of dough and punch it down on a lightly floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a circle. Place the pizza on a pizza peel or pan that has been generously coated with corn meal. Lightly brush the dough with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Top the dough with fresh mozzarella rounds, peach slices, and fresh basil. Drizzle the pizza with balsamic reduction. Follow these same steps to make the second pizza. 2. Place the pizza in the oven-directly on the pizza stone, if using one, or on the oven rack. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until pizza crust is golden and cheese is melted. Remove from oven and bake the second pizza. 3. Let the pizza cool for a few minutes and then cut into slices and serve warm.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"To make the pizza dough","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a glass measuring cup or small bowl, combine yeast and 1 cup warm water.","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"water.jpg"},{"id":18375,"name":"yeast","image":"yeast.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404766,"name":"measuring cup","image":"measuring-cup.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add a pinch of sugar and let sit for 5 minutes.","ingredients":[{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":5,"unit":"minutes"}},{"number":3,"step":"In the bowl of a stand mixer, add semolina flour, all-purpose flour, and salt.","ingredients":[{"id":20081,"name":"all purpose flour","image":"flour.png"},{"id":10020066,"name":"semolina flour","image":"cornmeal.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404665,"name":"stand mixer","image":"stand-mixer.jpg"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":4,"step":"Mix the ingredients until combined.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[]},{"number":5,"step":"Add the yeast mixture to the flour mixture.

Stir the Greek yogurt well and then add to the soup with the parsley and cooked rice.  Stir well to incorporate the yogurt.  Bring the soup back to a simmer and cook for another 15-20 minutes. Season with pepper and additional salt as necessary.Cassie's Notes:A couple of readers have written back to say that their yogurt curdled when adding it to the soup.  I have updated the recipe to instruct to use room temperature yogurt, and to remove the soup from the heat for a few minutes before adding the yogurt.  If you are worried about the yogurt curdling, you could add a ladle-full of slightly cooled soup to the yogurt and stir well, and then add back into the soup.  By doing this, you are \"tempering\" the yogurt in hopes that it will incorporate without curdling.  Especially take this step if you use non-fat yogurt.  Sour cream can also be subbed for the Greek yogurt.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat.","ingredients":[{"id":4053,"name":"olive oil","image":"olive-oil.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404667,"name":"dutch oven","image":"dutch-oven.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add the shallots, garlic, celery, and carrots with a pinch of salt and cook, 3-5 minutes, until softened, translucent and fragrant.

Season with pepper and additional salt as necessary.Cassie's Notes:A couple of readers have written back to say that their yogurt curdled when adding it to the soup.  I have updated the recipe to instruct to use room temperature yogurt, and to remove the soup from the heat for a few minutes before adding the yogurt.  If you are worried about the yogurt curdling, you could add a ladle-full of slightly cooled soup to the yogurt and stir well, and then add back into the soup.  By doing this, you are \"tempering\" the yogurt in hopes that it will incorporate without curdling.  Especially take this step if you use non-fat yogurt.  Sour cream can also be subbed for the Greek yogurt.","ingredients":[{"id":11297,"name":"parsley","image":"parsley.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"}],"equipment":[],"length":{"number":20,"unit":"minutes"}}]}],"creditsText":"Bake Your Day"},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":true,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":11,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"ketogenic":false,"whole30":false,"preparationMinutes":40,"cookingMinutes":0,"sourceUrl":"http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/9821/fruit-and-nut-chocolate-chequers","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/fruit-nut-chocolate-chequers-211512","aggregateLikes":21,"spoonacularScore":25.0,"healthScore":2.0,"creditText":"BBC Good Food","sourceName":"BBC Good Food","pricePerServing":119.56,"extendedIngredients":[{"id":12061,"aisle":"Nuts","image":"almonds.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"almonds","original":"8 toasted almonds, halved","originalString":"8 toasted almonds, halved","originalName":null,"amount":8.0,"unit":"","meta":["toasted","halved"],"metaInformation":["toasted","halved"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":8.0,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""},"metric":{"amount":8.0,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""}}},{"id":9426,"aisle":"Produce;Baking","image":"candied-orange.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"candied orange peel","original":"1 tbsp candied peel","originalString":"1 tbsp candied peel","originalName":null,"amount":1.0,"unit":"tbsp","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1.0,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"},"metric":{"amount":1.0,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"}}},{"id":12087,"aisle":"Nuts;Savory Snacks","image":"cashews.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"cashews","original":"8 sugared cashews","originalString":"8 sugared cashews","originalName":null,"amount":8.0,"unit":"","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":8.0,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""},"metric":{"amount":8.0,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""}}},{"id":19904,"aisle":"Sweet Snacks","image":"dark-chocolate-pieces.jpg","consitency":"liquid","name":"dark chocolate","original":"150g dark chocolate","originalString":"150g dark chocolate","originalName":null,"amount":150.0,"unit":"g","meta":["dark"],"metaInformation":["dark"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":5.291,"unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces"},"metric":{"amount":150.0,"unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams"}}},{"id":9079,"aisle":"Dried Fruits;Produce","image":"dried-cranberries.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"dried cranberries","original":"1 tbsp dried cranberries or raisins","originalString":"1 tbsp dried cranberries or raisins","originalName":null,"amount":1.0,"unit":"tbsp","meta":["dried"],"metaInformation":["dried"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1.0,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"},"metric":{"amount":1.0,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"}}},{"id":12142,"aisle":"Nuts;Baking","image":"pecans.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"pecan","original":"8 pecan halves","originalString":"8 pecan halves","originalName":null,"amount":8.0,"unit":"","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":8.0,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""},"metric":{"amount":8.0,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""}}},{"id":9302,"aisle":"Produce","image":"raspberries.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"raspberry","original":"1 tbsp dried raspberry flakes","originalString":"1 tbsp dried raspberry flakes","originalName":null,"amount":1.0,"unit":"tbsp","meta":["dried"],"metaInformation":["dried"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1.0,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"},"metric":{"amount":1.0,"unitShort":"Tbsp","unitLong":"Tbsp"}}},{"id":19087,"aisle":"Baking","image":"white-chocolate.jpg","consitency":"liquid","name":"white chocolate","original":"150g white chocolate","originalString":"150g white chocolate","originalName":null,"amount":150.0,"unit":"g","meta":["white"],"metaInformation":["white"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":5.291,"unitShort":"oz","unitLong":"ounces"},"metric":{"amount":150.0,"unitShort":"g","unitLong":"grams"}}}],"id":211512,"title":"Fruit & nut chocolate chequers","readyInMinutes":40,"servings":8,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/211512-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","cuisines":[],"dishTypes":["beverage","drink"],"diets":["gluten free","dairy free"],"occasions":[],"winePairing":{},"instructions":"Roughly chop the chocolate on choppingboards with a large sharp knife – choppingrather than breaking it into squares will helpit to melt nice and quickly.

Acidity is fused with the wine's body and aids the transmission of pleasant sensations of warmth and strength. The wine features a long finish that is unusual for a regular Chianti Classico.Conclusions: Those who argue that Chianti Classico is a prickly and rough wine will change their minds after tasting this 1999, which is ready to drink now but will improve for at least five years more.Alcohol: 13.5% by volume","price":"$24.49","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/440954-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.86,"ratingCount":6.0,"score":0.8073684210526315,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Ffonterutoli-chianti-classico-1998%2F12434"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                Heat meatballs according to package directions.
