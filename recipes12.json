Full-bodied red wines like malbec and cabernet sauvignon are the perfect accompaniment for beef stew. Fish stew probably calls for a white wine, such as chablis. You could try Gnarly Head Cabernet Sauvignon. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.8 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 12 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":442127,"title":"Gnarly Head Cabernet Sauvignon","description":"Gold Medal Winner: 2014 Los Angeles International Wine CompetitionGnarly Head 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon is King - big, gallant and powerful. This dark, bold Cabernet has solid tannins and jammy fruit, with aromas of black cherry, blackberry, freshly-cracked black peppercorn, violet and charred notes. On the palate, flavors of dense black fruit compote and currant followed by a trio of clove, spice and earth, lead to a generous, lingering finish.Try pairing this Cabernet with grilled lamb skewers, strong cheeses or a spaghetti Bolognese.","price":"$11.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/442127-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.96,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8975,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fgnarly-head-cabernet-sauvignon-2012%2F129675"}]},"instructions":"Directions                                                                                Combine flour and pepper; toss with beef cubes.

Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Tramin Pinot Grigio. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 18 dollars.","productMatches":[{"id":448227,"title":"Tramin Pinot Grigio","description":"Bright yellow in color with coppery reflections and clear fruit aromas of pear, citrus, honeysuckle, tropical fruits and light spices.

Add onions, 1 tablespoon butter, and 2 tablespoons water to skillet. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly and scraping up browned bits from bottom of skillet until water evaporates and onions start to fry and leave brown residue on bottom of pan. Add another two tablespoons water and continue to cook. Repeat two more times until water is used up and onions are soft and deep golden brown. Add collected juices from meat plate to onions and continue to cook for 30 seconds.

Let it cook for a moment, then throw in the bay, garlic, shallots and chilli. Cook for 2 mins until soft but not coloured, then add the celery and tomatoes. Sweat everything down gently for 20-30 mins until the tomatoes lose their shape. Remove from the heat, season and leave to cool. This can be made a few days in advance and kept in the fridge.To make the burgers, mix the egg yolks in a large bowl with the oyster sauce and soaked breadcrumbs. Season with lots of fresh, black pepper then add the meat, breaking it up a little. Mix everything, trying not to overwork the mixture or the burger will become heavy.Take the mix and divide in half, then into half and half again so you end up with 8 even pieces.

Peel the paper off one side and slap down in the pan with no oil or seasoning. Peel the top layer of paper off and cook on a very high heat for a couple of mins.

I turn my burgers after 2 mins, but I cook on a very high heat, and I like them a little pink. Keep warm in a low oven while you cook the rest, topping with the cheese slices, if you like, for the final few mins so they melt a little.Lay the 2 halves of the warm bun in front of you and butter them lightly.

Dice butter and place into flour mixture. (It is important for the butter to be COLD so sometimes I dice it up then place in a bowl and stick in the freezer for a few minutes.) Use a pastry knife and cut butter into flour until it is edamame or pea sized.Using a large fork, add 3 tablespoons of the ice water to the mixture and combine. Continue adding water until dough just comes together. You may not need to add all the water; you want the dough to be smooth but neither wet nor dry. I find 4-5 tablespoons to be good.If you want to make the dough in the food processor, here is how: Add the flour and salt with the regular blade attached, then add the diced cold butter. Pulse just a few times to lightly mix the ingredients until there are pea-sized balls. Add the water and process again until the dough is crumbly. Do not let it turn into a big dough ball or you will have overmixed the dough. Pour into a floured surface and gather into a disk, wrap in plastic and place in fridge until you are ready to roll out.In a large pot, add 1 teaspoon butter and chicken. Cook chicken until no longer pink, about 5 minutes, then transfer to a bowl and set aside.Next add almond milk and chicken broth to pot and bring to a boil. Add in potatoes and carrots and boil for 3-4 minutes. (This helps to release the potato starch!). Drain the mixture over a bowl, reserving the cooking liquid (very important). Set aside the carrots and potatoes for later.Next melt 1 teaspoon butter in the same pot you've been using. Add in onions and cook for 3-4 minutes until translucent. Vigorously whisk in 1/3 cup flour and 1/2 cup chicken broth at the same time until smooth and no lumps remain. Stir in reserved cooking liquid, potatoes, carrots, chicken, frozen peas, thyme, salt and pepper. Simmer over medium low heat for 10-15 minutes or until mixture thickens. Taste and adjust seasonings as necessary. Remove from heat.Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.Coat a deep skillet or large deep dish pie pan with nonstick cooking spray (you can also use a 2 quart sized skillet). Add pot pie mixture.Roll out the pie dough out on a very well floured surface so that it's large enough to cover the pie pan. Place on top of mixture, pressing the edges and sealing. Cut a few slits in top of crust or poke holes with a fork to let steam escape. Spray the top of the crust with a little nonstick cooking spray.Bake at 375 degrees F for 45-55 minutes or until crust is golden and filling is bubbly. Top crust with sea salt and extra fresh thyme.

Add onions and saute until nearly softened, about 5 minutes. Add in garlic, ginger and jalapeno and saute until softened, about 5 minutes. Add in the curry paste, curry powder, and cumin. Season with salt to taste and cook 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in 1/4 cup water. Transfer curry mixture to a food processor and puree until smooth, about 2 minutes. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp oil in same pot over medium heat. Add curry mixture and cook 1 minute. Add the garbanzo beans, cauliflower, and bell pepper (I actually waited until the last 5 minutes of cooking to add bell pepper just so it had a more vibrant color and a tender crisp texture) and toss to coat with curry mixture. Stir in vegetable broth, tomato sauce, and coconut milk. Season with salt to taste and bring to a light boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally (original recipe lists simmer covered for 30 and uncovered for 15, but I prefer a slightly thicker consistency). Serve warm over rice, topped with green onions and plenty of cilantro.
