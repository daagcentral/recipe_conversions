Grease a large baking sheet or line with parchment first and lightly grease. Add the potatoes and drizzle 2 - 3 tablespoons olive oil over them and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Use your hands to massage the oil all over the potatoes. Bake until fork tender about 30 minutes.In a medium bowl whisk the mayo, buttermilk, garlic and vinegar together. Stir in the Roquefort and season to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerate.Use a mortar and pestle to crush the peppercorns or smash them with a meat mallet on a cutting board - cover them with a paper towel then a dish towel and pound until crushed.Lightly oil a large cast-iron skillet and set over high heat. Salt the steak well on both sides then press one side down into the peppercorns.When the pan is smoking hot lay the steak in - peppercorn side down and turn heat down to medium-high. You kind of have to use your own judgment for cooking the steak depending on its size and how rare you like it. This is how I did mine and it weighed about a pound: Cook about 4 - 5 minutes on the first side for medium well steak (pink but not bloody in the middle) then flip and cook on the other side 3 - 4 minutes. Remove to a cutting board and cover with foil. Let sit 5 - 10 minutes before slicing.Divide the romaine among 4 plates followed by the potatoes and any extras you like. Slice the steak thinly against the grain and plate. Drizzle very generously with the blue cheese dressing.Serve hot, warm or at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
