Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.","productMatches":[]},"instructions":"Brine the pork chops (optional step but recommended): In a saucepan large enough to accommodate the chops, add the first 2 cups water, cinnamon stick, thyme, star anise, salt and coriander seeds. Bring this to a boil on the stove just to dissolve the salt and coax out the flavor of the spices. Set aside for a few minutes to let the flavors infuse the liquid then add the remaining two cups water. Make sure that the liquid is at room temperature or tepid before adding the chops. Leave the meat in the brine, refrigerated, for a minimum of 1 hour up to 24 hours.To prepare the Pork Chops: Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Take them out of the brine and pat dry. It would be better if they were close to room temperature before you cook them. Season with a bit of salt and pepper on both sides. Heat about 2 tablespoons of oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, Add the pork chops to the pan and sear the first side for 3 minutes or until the meat is nicely brown. You can then flip the meat over and transfer to the oven to finish cooking but if you're also preparing the fregola pasta, transfer the meat to a foil-lined baking sheet instead so you can use the skillet for the pasta. The meat may take 4-6 minutes depending on the thickness of the chops. While the meat is in the oven, prepare the fregola pasta.To prepare the Fregola Sarda: Using the same skillet that the pork chops seared in and keeping the heat at medium or medium-high, add a splash or two of wine to deglaze. Scrape the bottom of the skillet to loosen the flavor from the meat. You can add a bit more oil but if there's enough to loosen the starchy pasta you can skip this step. I added about 1 more tablespoon before adding the fregola pasta to the skillet. Stir fry the pasta in the oil for a minute or two, just until the pasta begins to separate again (the starch develops when you drain it after cooking so some may stick together but the oil loosens them up again). Add a couple splashes of chicken stock and just to loosen the pasta a bit more and sprinkle a little fresh lemon juice. If you feel it needs salt, add just a little.Transfer the stir-fried fregola sarda to a bowl and toss in the persimmon and mint. Taste again--I added a bit more lemon juice and drizzled a bit more olive oil but this just my preference. Set aside.To prepare the dandelions greens: Stir fry in the same skillet you cooked the pork chops and the pasta in or use a different pan. Heat a tablespoon or two of oil, add the sliced garlic and when the garlic is fragrant, about 10-20 seconds, add the dandelion greens. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the greens have wilted down. Season with a bit of salt and add a bit of lemon juice for flavor.Arrange the pork chop, pasta and greens on a plate and serve.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Brine the pork chops (optional step but recommended): In a saucepan large enough to accommodate the chops, add the first 2 cups water, cinnamon stick, thyme, star anise, salt and coriander seeds.

Toss in the cold, cubed butter and then, using your fingers or a dough cutter, work the butter into the flour mixture. Try to work quickly and break the butter down into the flour mixture.Whisk together the egg and buttermilk (or water). Create a well in the butter and flour mixture and pour in the cold buttermilk/egg mixture. Use a fork to bring the dough together. On a lightly floured work surface, dump out the dough mixture. It will be moist and shaggy. Gently knead the dough into round, flat disks.Grease a 9 or 10 inch spring form pan with cooking spray, sprinkle the bottom and sides of the pan with toasted sesame seeds. Roll the dough out on a lightly flour surface to a 15-inch circle. Press the dough into the bottom of the prepared pan and up the sides. Line the dough with tin foil, pushing the foil down onto the dough and up and around the sides, then refrigerate for 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. After 30 minutes, place the pan in the oven and cook for 10-15 minutes or until the crust is just set. Remove from the oven and remove the foil. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F.Meanwhile, make the filling. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the butter. Once melted, add the onion and cook over medium-low heat for about 10 minutes or until caramelized. Stir in the spinach and sun-dried, cook until the spinach is wilted. Add the dried thyme and dill. Season with salt and pepper. Make sure all the moisture has cooked out of the spinach and then remove from the heat. Allow the mixture to cool 5-10 minutes and then stir in the havarti cheese, cheddar cheese and gruyere cheese. Spoon the spinach mixture into the bottom of the pre-baked pie crust.Add the eggs, greek yogurt, milk and nutmeg to a blender and blend until smooth, about 30 seconds. Season with a little salt and pepper. Pour the egg mixture over the spinach.Bake for 15 minutes and then remove from the oven and add the torn prosciutto. Continue to bake another hour. Allow the quiche to sit 20 minutes before cutting and then sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and flakey sea salt.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the crust, whisk together the flour, 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds and salt in a medium size bowl.
