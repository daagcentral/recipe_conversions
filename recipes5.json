Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti.

Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).2. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Cut in the butter with a pastry blender or a fork or 2 knives held crisscross fashion until the mixture is the consistency of rolled oats. Add the cheese and nuts and toss to coat with flour.3. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add 1 1/2 cups buttermilk and the egg. Stir with a sturdy spoon until you have a shaggy dough.4. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead gently to bring it together. Form the dough into a slightly flattened 6-inch round. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush with the remaining 1 tablespoon buttermilk and sprinkle with pepper. Using a serrated knife, cut a shallow “X” in the top of the loaf.5. Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C) and bake for 35 minutes, or until the loaf is deep golden brown and sounds hollow when thumped on the bottom.

Combine the melted butter with the crumbs and mix until its thick.Lightly spray a mini cheesecake pan with non-stick cooking spray. Place a heaping 1/2 tbsp of oreo crumbs in each cheesecake well, and press the mixture down firmly using a spatula. Place in the freezer for 15 minutes to harden.In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the white chocolate chips and heavy cream. Stir occasionally, until the chips are melted and smooth. This may take up to 10 minutes, but keep the heat on low or a little higher than low.Once melted, remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool on the counter for 15 minutes.Once the chocolate is cool, combine the melted chocolate, chopped oreos, and softened cream cheese in a mixing bowl. Beat using an electric mixer until the mixture is smooth and no lumps remain. Spoon or pipe the cheesecake mixture into the cheesecake wells. Use a spatula to push the cheesecake into the well and to smooth the top.For best results refrigerate the mini cheesecakes over night, be sure to cover with tinfoil or plastic wrap. 2 hours before serving, move the cheesecakes into the freezer. This will help the cheesecakes harden, making them easier to remove.To remove: Use a finger to press up on the removable buttons, sliding the cheesecakes up and out of the pan. Place the cheesecakes on a small baking sheet and return them to the freezer while you make the chocolate topping.In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the chocolate chips and vegetable shortening. Stir occasionally, until the chips are melted and smooth. This may take up to 10 minutes, but keep the heat on low or a little higher than low. Once the chocolate is melted, add the powdered sugar to the mixture and stir until no lumps remain. The mixture should be thicker at this point. Remove the cheesecakes from the freezer and spoon some chocolate on top of each cheesecake. You want the topping to drip down the sides of the cheesecakes, without being too runny.Begin to melt the chocolate candiquik and vegetable shortening in a small pot over low. It might take 8-10 minutes for the chocolate to melt completely. But keep the temperature on low.To dip, place the oreo in the saucepan with melted chocolate. Use a spoon to spoon chocolate on top of the oreo, if needed. To remove the oreo, use a fork to lift it out of the chocolate. To remove excess chocolate from the oreo on the fork, tap your wrist 2 times with your other hand. Scrape the bottom of the fork on the edge of the saucepan to remove more chocolate, then move the oreo to a baking sheet lined with a silpat or wax paper. Use a toothpick to help get the oreo off the fork and onto the baking sheet smoothly.Continue this process until all of the oreos are dipped. Allow them to harden at room temperature.Once the oreos are cooled and the chocolate has set completely, you can begin to decorate them with the royal icing. To make the royal icing combine the 3 ingredients in a bowl and beat using an electric mixer.I like to transfer my royal icing to a squeeze bottle with a small tip. I feel like it gives me more control when decorating. Use the frosting to decorate each oreo with an XOXO.Before serving: Top each cheesecake with a dollop of cool whip and a chocolate dipped oreo.

until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the flour and mix until crumbly, about 1 minute. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and lightly knead with your hands to make a soft dough. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight.                          Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Make the filling: Put the dried cranberries and 1 tablespoon water in a medium microwave-safe bowl; microwave until plump, about 1 minute. Let cool. Stir in the pecans, the remaining 1/2 cup sugar and the cinnamon, then stir in the milk.                          Roll out the dough until 1/8 inch thick on a lightly floured surface. Cut out circles using a 3 1/2-inch-round cookie cutter. Gather the scraps; reroll once to cut more circles. Place a heaping teaspoonful of filling on the bottom third of each circle, leaving a small border. Brush the edges with a little milk, fold the dough over the filling and roll to enclose; pinch the 2 ends closed and bend into a crescent shape. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.                          Arrange the cookies 1 inch apart on the baking sheets; brush with milk and sprinkle with sugar. Bake, switching the pans halfway through, until lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheets.
