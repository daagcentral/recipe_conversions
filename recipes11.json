When the onions just turn translucent and the peppers are still crunchy. Set them aside over a large serving bowl along with any juice/liquid in the skillet.Saute aromatics: Use the same saute pan (there should be no liquid juice in the skillet), heat 1-2 tbsp avocado oil over medium-high heat.

A blend of approximately half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir this crystal bright, light-bodied Champagne is elegant and distinctive. Opening with aromas of fresh pineapple, lemon and white florals, warming into complex scents of pear. A rich bouquet of white fruits end in subtle notes of honey and vanilla. The bead is intense with brisk effervescence, swirling up into a generous and persistent mousse. It is a balanced, extremely refined wine that, if properly stored, should keep for years, especially if bottled in magnums or jeroboams.Beyond the toasts and ship launchings, Champagne has a place at every dinner table. The 1996 Fleur de Champagne pairs is the perfect wine to serve with smoked oysters, game hens, delicate Japanese fish dishes, Fettuccini Alfredo or risotto. After a patient search for a master glassmaker capable of reproducing a bottle with the 1902 Gallé design, Perrier Jouët launched in 1969, its famous \"flower bottle\" with an arabesque design of anemones. The first bottles of Fleur de Champagne revealed a Champagne of vivacious delicacy, the epitome of the refined and engaging style of the Art Nouveau movement. Since then, it has been the signature Champagne of Perrier Jouët and is considered one of the world's most celebrated Champagnes.","price":"$129.0","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/433586-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8800000000000001,"ratingCount":6.0,"score":0.8273684210526318,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fperrier-jouet-belle-epoque-1996%2F7383"}]},"instructions":"Cook Rice-A-Roni according to instructions on the package.Place a large skillet over medium/high heat.

Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti.

It is a good idea, especially if you want to spit roast it, to truss the bird to keep the legs and wings in place. Then season the bird by rubbing salt and pepper into the skin of the bird and drizzling olive oil all over it. Once your bird is stuffed, seasoned and trussed, you roast it. The best way is to use the rotisserie on your barbecue. Set some aluminum pans with some water or wine in them below the bird to catch the drippings, and turn on the burners to each side, but not those directly beneath the bird. If you have a rotisserie burner, turn that on as well.Start your rotisserie turning, close the lid of your barbecue and let the chicken roast until it is golden brown all over. The internal temperature should reach around 70 C/160 F. Roasting should take about 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the size of your bird. If you don't have a barbecue rotisserie available, you can also roast your chicken, on a rack, in a hot oven (200 C/400 F). If your oven has a rotisserie, so much the better. If you don't have a rotisserie function, you will want to baste the bird from time to time with a bit of wine or olive oil to keep it moist. After the chicken has been roasted, leave it to rest, tented with aluminum foil, for about 20-30 minutes before serving. Serve the chicken, cut into pieces, sprinkled with salt and, if you like, decorated with your favorite aromatic herbs for a bit of color and aroma.

Cut a piece of extra-wide aluminum foil a little longer than the length of the salmon. Place an equally long piece of plastic wrap on top of the foil. Sprinkle one-third of the salt rub onto the plastic. Lay one side of the salmon skin-side down onto the rub. Sprinkle another third of the rub onto the flesh of the salmon. Place the second side of the salmon flesh-side down onto the first side. Use the remaining rub to cover the skin on the top piece. Fold the plastic over the salmon to cover, and then close the edges of the foil together and crimp tightly around the salmon. The salmon should be folded in half and wrapped.                          Place the wrapped salmon on a baking sheet and top with another baking sheet. Weigh the top pan down with a brick or two. Refrigerate the salmon for 12 hours. Flip the salmon over and refrigerate for another 12 hours. Some juice will leak out during the refrigeration process, so make sure there's a place for the runoff to gather.                          Unwrap the salmon and rinse off the salt rub with cold water. Pat the salmon dry with paper towels and place in a cool, dry place (not the refrigerator) until the surface of the salmon is dry and matte-like, 1 to 3 hours depending on humidity. A fan may be used to speed the process.                          Preheat the smoker. Smoke the salmon over the smoldering alder wood chips until the thickest part of the salmon registers 150 degrees, about 30 minutes. Keep the temperature inside the smoker between 190 and 200 degrees F. Serve the salmon immediately, or cool to room temperature, wrap tightly and refrigerate for up to 3 days.                          Meanwhile, for the pizza dough: Place the warm water and yeast in a large bowl. When the yeast dissolves, let the water stand about 5 minutes. Stir in 3 cups of the flour and the fine salt until smooth. Stir in an additional 2 cups of the flour and continue adding flour (up to 1/2 cup) 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes away from the bowl but is still sticky.                          Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, and knead with lightly floured hands. Slap the dough onto the counter, pulling it toward you with one hand and pushing it away from you with the other. Fold the dough back over itself using a bench scraper or a wide knife to help scrape dough from surface. Repeat the process until the dough is easier to handle, about 10 times. Finish kneading until the dough is smooth, elastic and soft, but a little tacky, about 10 minutes.                          Lightly oil a bowl with olive oil. Shape the dough into 2 balls and transfer to the bowl. Turn to coat the dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place until the dough doubles in volume, about 3 hours. The dough is done when you press it with your finger and an indent remains.                          Gently remove the dough from the bowl. Roll each dough half into a ball and place on a lightly-floured baking sheet. Brush the dough balls lightly with olive oil. Cover the baking sheet lightly with plastic wrap and set aside for 15 minutes.                          Prepare charcoal in a chimney starter (allowing the charcoal to burn until all the charcoal is covered with a thin layer of gray ash). Add to the grill, creating a two-level fire by spreading the coals out over half the grill bottom, piling them up in a mound 3 briquettes high, and leaving the other half with no coals.                          Stretch and shape each piece of dough into a 10-inch-round on a flat surface. Brush the tops of each round with canola oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place the rounds on the grilling stones and cook until the bottoms are lightly golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush the tops of the rounds with oil, flip and cook until the bottoms are lightly golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.                          For the assembly: Whisk the creme fraiche, chopped herbs, zest together and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Spread the creme fraiche mixture on top of each cooked dough round. Flake some of the smoked salmon and place on top of the creme fraiche mixture. Top with the capers and onions. Garnish with whole herbs. Serve immediately.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Special equipment: alder woodchips, soaked in cold water for 4 hours","ingredients":[{"id":14412,"name":"water","image":"water.jpg"}],"equipment":[]}]},{"name":"For the assembly","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Whisk the creme fraiche, chopped herbs, zest together and sprinkle with salt and pepper.","ingredients":[{"id":1102047,"name":"salt and pepper","image":"salt-and-pepper.jpg"},{"id":1001056,"name":"creme fraiche","image":"sour-cream.jpg"},{"id":1002044,"name":"herbs","image":"mixed-fresh-herbs.jpg"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Spread the creme fraiche mixture on top of each cooked dough round.

Chenin Blanc pairs well with a wide range of foods, especially sushi, oysters, Asian curries, sweet-and-sour dishes, and summer salads.Blend: 87% Chenin Blanc, 13% Viognier","price":"$8.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/439943-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8400000000000001,"ratingCount":12.0,"score":0.8129729729729731,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fessay-chenin-blanc-2014%2F139942"}]},"instructions":"For the broth: Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F.

Whisk together the marinade ingredients and pour into the bag. Massage the bag to disperse the marinade. Let marinade at least 6 hours, giving it a shake every now and then.Remove flank steak from marinade bag and lay flat on a large plastic cutting board. Let rest for 3o minutes before stuffing it. You want the meat to come close to room temperature.While the flank steak is coming to room temperature, in a saute pan, heat 1 Tbsp oil over medium heat. Saut garlic for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add onions and bell peppers and cook until soft and browned, adding a couple of tablespoons of water as necessary while cooking. This process will take around 15 minutes. Once the onion mixture is properly browned, remove from heat.Preheat oven to 375.Carefully spread the goat cheese and onion mixture evenly over the steak. Leave about an inch around the edges of the flank steak clear of any stuffing. Roll the steak tightly along the grain (if the grain is going left-to-right, roll that way opposed to top-to-bottom) and secure with kitchen twine. Season all sides liberally with sea salt and cracked pepper.Heat 2 Tbsp oil and in an oven-safe saute pan over high heat until very hot. Sear the rolled steak 1-2 minutes on each side until very nicely browned. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook until the internal temperature reaches 135 (this took about 15 minutes in my oven). Remove from the oven and remove the meat from pan to a clean cutting board (this ensures your meat does not keep cooking in the pan). Cover with foil and let the meat rest 10 minutes.Slice flank steak into 1/2-inch rounds.Spoon grits into a bowl and top with stuffed flank steak.For the Creamy Grits:Bring water and milk to a rapid boil in a heavy saucepan. Add 4 tablespoons butter, a pinch of salt, and grits. Stir until water boils again. Lower heat to a simmer, cover and continue cooking for 20 minutes, stirring often. Once grits have reached the desired texture, add remaining 4 tablespoons butter and 1 cup sharp cheddar cheese. Add salt and pepper, to taste (I use about 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon fresh cracked pepper in mine). Serve immediately.For leftover grits: Pour into a glass and chill.

Add the harissa and garlic and cook 1 minute. Remove from the heat, cover and let sit 1 hour to allow the flavors to meld.                          Make the pickled saffron shallots: Bring the vinegar, sugar, 1 teaspoon salt and the saffron to a boil in a small saucepan set over medium heat; remove from the heat and let cool 10 minutes. Put the shallots in a small bowl, pour the vinegar mixture over them, cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours.                          Make the aioli: Combine the mayonnaise, harissa, smoked paprika, piquillo peppers, anchovy and lemon juice in a blender and blend until smooth; season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.                          Make the crispy prosciutto: Heat the canola oil in a small saute pan over medium heat until it shimmers. Add 1 slice of the prosciutto at a time to the pan and cook until just crisp. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels.                          Make the burgers: Combine the chuck and fat in a meat grinder and grind coarsely into a large bowl (or put the ground beef in a large bowl). Mix in some salt and pepper. Divide the meat into 4 equal patties.                          Heat a cast-iron pan over high heat until smoking. Add the canola oil and burgers and cook until the bottoms are golden brown and a crust has formed, about 4 minutes. Flip over and begin brushing with the spiced butter. Cook until the bottoms are golden brown and the meat is cooked to medium, 4 more minutes. Top the burgers with the fontina, add a little water to the pan, cover quickly and cook until the cheese is completely melted, about 1 minute.                          Spread some aioli on the top and bottom buns. Place a burger on each bottom bun; top with some of the pickled shallots, followed by a slice of crispy prosciutto and some arugula.

On a large plate combine the flour, black pepper, cayenne pepper, dried ginger, & salt.Dip the chicken pieces in the egg wash then dredge them in the flour mixture. Place on a lightly greased baking sheet and lightly drizzle the tops with a little olive oil (or spray the tops with pan spray.) Bake at 375*F for about 25-30 minutes. Flip the pieces at half way through the cooking time.  While the chicken is baking, prepare your sauce. Don’t walk away from this sauce; it gets very hot when making the caramel base and can burn easily so pay careful attention while cooking it.PART I FOR THE SAUCE: In a small bowl, mix together.  Set this mixture aside.PART II FOR THE SAUCE: In a medium saucepan give a quick stir to the sugar & water to get all the sugar wet, & then DO NOT STIR the rest of the cooking period until adding the other sauce components.  Next, boil the sugar & water over medium heat, watching constantly until the caramel starts to turn a light amber color (again, NO STIRRING) and you can begin to smell the caramel. When it reaches this stage, give the other ingredients in the bowl a quick stir to make sure the cornstarch is dissolved then add it all at once to the hot caramel.  Be careful when combining the two mixtures because this sauce can foam up considerably for a few seconds and it is very hot.  (Your caramel may seize up for a minute, just keep stirring & it will work itself out & be smooth again.)Simmer for only few minutes and remove from the heat and allow to cool down slightly.  (If the sauce isn't as thick as you would like, go ahead & add a cornstarch slurry [1.5 parts cornstarch to 1 part COLD water] to the boiling sauce & it should thicken up some more & then you can let it cool down.)Toss the sauce with the cooked chicken pieces and serve over plain steamed rice & top with chopped green onions.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"FOR THE CHICKEN: Make egg wash & place in a bowl.
